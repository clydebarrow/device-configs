### GPIO Pin Configuration

Specify which GPIO pins on the device are used. For each pin that is used on the device, provide a label to identify its function, e.g. "LCD_CS" for the chip select pin of a display, or "UART_TX" for the UART transmit pin.

GPIO0 is often used for a boot button and if so should be labeled "BOOT".

At least one pin must be specified.

Select a chip type to see the available pins for the device.
