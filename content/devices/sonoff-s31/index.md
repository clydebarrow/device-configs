## Basic Configuration

## Warnings

- `board: esp12e` is required to enable all 4MB of flash, allowing OTA updates to work after approximately version 2024.4.0
- `throttle_average: 60s` on cse7766 sensors is highly recommended with version 2024.2.0 or greater.
- `restore_mode: ALWAYS_OFF` avoids potential damage or instability when using the programmerâ€™s supply.
