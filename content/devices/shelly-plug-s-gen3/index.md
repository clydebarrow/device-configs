## Overview

Generation 3 of Shelly Plug-S
At this moment there is NO way to Flash it OTA. You need to open the Plug and use UART!
As always, first take a dump!
```esptool -b 115200 --port COM11 read_flash 0x00000 0x800000 shelly_plug_s_gen3.bin```

## Open the device

This little seal need to drill open, best you use a prick punch with an M3.5-M4 Drill.
![Drill](../Shelly-Plug-S-Gen3/drill_1.png "Drill M3.5 or M4")
When the seal is cracked open, you need a M2 drill, and drill in center, just a little.
![Drill](../Shelly-Plug-S-Gen3/drill_2.png "Drill M2")
Now take a tapered punch and press the seal out. The whole grounding receptacle will come out.
We need some hot-air (~300Â°C) and 5 of the iFixit triangle-plastic, there are 3 spots with glue.
Heat them up, and try placeing the plastic around.
![Open it up](../Shelly-Plug-S-Gen3/open_1.png "create a gap")
You will get a little gap, take anohter plastic and g et betweet the withe and transparent plastic, and make a circle.

After 2 rounds you can easly take it out.
