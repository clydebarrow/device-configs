## Overview

Another Costco Variant. **Do not confuse with Feit BPA800/RGBW/AG/2 as they use different GPIO pin numbers.**
Be warned that you will have to disassemble the device to flash the firmware if it is newer than about March 2020.
Tuya changed their firmware such that tuya-convert no longer works as before.
