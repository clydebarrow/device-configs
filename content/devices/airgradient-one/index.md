## Overview

The AirGradient ONE monitor measures PM, CO2, TVOC, NOx, temperature and relative humidity from [AirGradient](https://www.airgradient.com/open-airgradient/instructions/one-v9/).
If you have multiple of these devices, you will likely need to make each sensor name unique across the boards
(e.g. "AirGradient Temperature 1"), so there aren't naming conflicts.
